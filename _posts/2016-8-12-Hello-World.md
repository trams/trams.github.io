I set up a new blog hosting on Github using the help of [this article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)

So this is my first blog post (and probably the last one :))
My previous blog was hosted on Livejournal (yes, it still exists!)
You can find it [here](http://tramsm.livejournal.com/). Beware! There are a lot of posts in russian.
