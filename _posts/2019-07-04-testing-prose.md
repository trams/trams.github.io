## Should I use an online editor?

[This article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) suggests to use [prose.io](https://prose.io) to write new posts without ever using
command line to clone, write posts and push them. I like my command line and being a software engineer
I will always have it around me but I also like to try new tools.

Here is my test blog post :) The second one on this platfrom. It has been 3 years since the first one.
We would see when I would blog the next time
