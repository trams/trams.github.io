My name is Oleksandr Pryimak. But I like when people call me Sasha. I am a software engineer.
I live in Paris and work for Criteo. My job description is "training elephants"

In my spare time I enjoy cooking, good food, traveling and riding a bike. Imagine how should I like the idea of traveling around Italy by bike!

### More Information

My area of professional interests is high performance computational systems. Basically I like to think about how to crunch a lot of numbers quikly without loosing your mind.
