My name is Oleksandr Pryimak. But I also go Sasha (my other Slavic name).
I am a software engineer. I live in San Francisco and work for Thumbtack.

Before 2020 I worked for Criteo
My job description used to be "training elephants" but most of 2018-2019
I mostly spent building ML data pipelines and improving xgboost

In my spare time I enjoy cooking, good food, traveling and riding a bike. Imagine how should I like the idea of traveling around Spain by bike!

### More Information

My area of professional interests is high performance computational systems and ML Infra.
Basically I like to think about how to crunch a lot of numbers quikly without loosing your mind.
